# HTML-CSS-and-Git-Code-Refactor

This project was developed for the company called Horiseon marketing to make their software code more streamlined and accessibility friendly

In this project I refactored the code then consolidated it accordingly. I have made the naming convention to be complying to semantics. Accessibility features were also added.
